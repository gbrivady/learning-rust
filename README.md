# learning-rust
Personal repo to learn rust, using [this ressource](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch01-01-installation.html).

## Project ideas

For when I have learned this language:

- Quantum SDK in a real (not Python) and modern (not C/C++) language
- Small puzzle game: Picross or Sudoku
- Factory game: shapez or something similar
- Small FE-like game
